This repository hosts DeepPurpose, a Deep Learning Based Molecular Modeling and Prediction Toolkit on Drug-Target Interaction Prediction, Compound Property Prediction, Protein-Protein Interaction Prediction, and Protein Function prediction (using PyTorch). We focus on DTI and its applications in Drug Repurposing and Virtual Screening, but support various other molecular encoding tasks. It allows very easy usage (several lines of codes only) to facilitate deep learning for life science research.

### Case Study 2 (a): Antiviral Drugs Repurposing for SARS-CoV2 3CLPro, using One Line.
  Given a new target sequence (e.g. SARS-CoV2 3CL Protease), retrieve a list of repurposing drugs from a curated drug library of 81 antiviral drugs. The Binding Score is the Kd values. Results aggregated from five pretrained model on BindingDB dataset! (Caution: this currently is for educational purposes. The pretrained DTI models only cover a small dataset and thus cannot generalize to every new unseen protein. For best use case, train your own model with customized data.)

For drug target pairs:
```
Drug1_SMILES Target1_Seq Score/Label
Drug2_SMILES Target2_Seq Score/Label
....
```
Then, use 

```python 
from DeepPurpose import dataset
X_drug, X_target, y = dataset.read_file_training_dataset_drug_target_pairs(PATH)
```

For bioassay training data:
```
Target_Seq
Drug1_SMILES Score/Label
Drug2_SMILES Score/Label
....
```

Then, use 

```python 
from DeepPurpose import dataset
X_drug, X_target, y = dataset.read_file_training_dataset_bioassay(PATH)
```

For drug property prediction training data:
```
Drug1_SMILES Score/Label
Drug2_SMILES Score/Label
....
```

Then, use 

```python 
from DeepPurpose import dataset
X_drug, y = dataset.read_file_compound_property(PATH)
```

For protein function prediction training data:
```
Target1_Seq Score/Label
Target2_Seq Score/Label
....
```

Then, use 

```python

```
Then, use 

```python 
from DeepPurpose import dataset
X_drug, X_drug_names = dataset.read_file_repurposing_library(PATH)
```

For target sequence to be repurposed:
```
Target_Name Target_seq 
```
Then, use 

```python

## Pretrained models
We provide more than 10 pretrained models. Please see [Pretraining Model Tutorial](DEMO/load_pretraining_models_tutorial.ipynb) on how to load them. It is as simple as 

```python
from DeepPurpose import DTI as models
net = models.model_pretrained(model = 'MPNN_CNN_DAVIS')
or
net = models.model_pretrained(FILE_PATH)
```
The list of avaiable pretrained models:

Model name consists of first the drug encoding, then the target encoding and then the trained dataset.

Note that for DTI models, the BindingDB and DAVIS are trained on log scale. But DeepPurpose allows you to specify conversion between log scale (e.g. pIC50) and original scale by the variable `convert_y`.
